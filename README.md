repository for the planet Shepherd project
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT :
Planet Shepherd's idea came to me after a series of lectures at my university about environmental challenges and how we need to adapt and change our energy use and sourcing to reduce inequalities and mankind's negative climatic impact. The initial goal was to model the entire planet earth including a huge amount of data, so that the program could, with parameter inputs from users (aka scenarii) compute how to best use the different energy sources available to us : gas, wind, solar, hydrolic, geothermy... 
It took a short time of reflection and a discussion with Pr.Vincent Berger (former Paris Diderot university president and physics researcher) to get to the conclusion that a full world simulation was a tad bit too ambitious for a group of students and a single semester. Therefore we have decided to start with only parts of the world (the first objective being a fully functionnal model of France) to show (and see) that such a project can work and have a real world value. 
This project is not fully independant, it is part of one of Denis Diderot engineering school module : transversal project, which calls for students to work on existing projects from other disciplines, and in groups of students from several specializations (the school has four of them : physical engineering, material and nanotechnologic engineering, biotechnologic engineering and software engineering). Wanting to take it further than simply grafting on a project on which I would've had no decision and choices to make, I decided to submit my own project to the school's board and recruit the adequate students myself.
